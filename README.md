# dusty

Dusty Engine is a cross-platform game engine written in C++.<br/>

features:<br/>
-cross-platform with use of SDL and OpenGL<br/>
-build-in server-client networking UDP/TCP over IPv4/IPv6<br/>
-continuous physics with swipe and prune algorithm<br/>
-multihreading with a threadpool<br/>

needed features:<br/>
-user interface described in files<br/>
-ingame voxel editor like tesseract<br/>

note: due to a recent move from Google Code to github, I have chose to change a lot of things in this version of this project (SFML to SDL, threading management, instanciation management, a complete recode of the physic engine and more), so it is still not compiling.
